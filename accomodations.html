    <p> Lofty, expansive rooms with vast, bright en-suite bathrooms and large private terraces are characteristic of the hotelâ€™s wonderful sense of space and use of natural light. There are 45 high-ceilinged suites, two of which are penthouse style Presidential Suites and 43 Junior Suites culminating in vaulted beams. Muted colors and textured fabrics in ecru and taupe create an ambiance of contemporary-chic while subtle touches of brass, mahogany and leather bear reference to the classic elegance of vintage East African safaris Beyond the balustrade of your private balcony.</p>
